Exploring routing protocols
===========================

Routing protocols play a key role in the Internet since they ensure that all the routers have valid routing tables. In this section, we use IPMininet_ to explore how intradomain and interdomain routing protocols work in practice. IPMininet_ adds an abstraction layer above the actual configuration of the FRRouting daemons that implement these routing protocols.


Exploring OSPF
--------------

We first use IPMininet_ to explore the operation of OSPFv3, the version of OSPF that supports IPv6. We create a simple network with three routers and two hosts as shown in the figure below.

     .. tikz:: A simple network
        :libs: shapes, positioning, matrix, arrows, shapes

        \tikzstyle{arrow} = [thick,->,>=stealth]
        \tikzset{router/.style = {rectangle, draw, text centered, minimum height=2em}, }
        \tikzset{host/.style = {circle, draw, text centered, minimum height=2em}, }
        \tikzset{ftable/.style={rectangle, dashed, draw} }
	\tikzset{as/.style={cloud, draw,cloud puffs=10,cloud puff arc=120, aspect=2, minimum height=1em, minimum width=1em} }

        \node[host] (a) {a};
        \node[router, right=of a] (r1) {r1};
        \node[router, right=of r1] (r2) {r2};
	\node[router, below right=of r1] (r3) {r3};
	\node[host, right=of r3] (b) {b};

	\path[draw, color=black]
	(a) edge (r1)
	(b) edge (r3)
	(r1) edge node [sloped, midway, above, color=black] {1} (r2)
	(r1) edge node [sloped, midway, above, color=black] {5} (r3)
	(r2) edge node [sloped, midway, above, color=black] {3} (r3);

.. code-block:: python

    import shlex
    from ipmininet.iptopo import IPTopo
    from ipmininet.ipnet import IPNet
    from ipmininet.cli import IPCLI

    class MyTopology(IPTopo):

        def build(self, *args, **kwargs):
            # Add routers (OSPF daemon is added by default with the default config)

            r1 = self.addRouter("r1")
            r2 = self.addRouter("r2")
            r3 = self.addRouter("r3")
            a = self.addHost("a")
            b = self.addHost("b")

            lr1r2 = self.addLink(r1, r2, igp_cost=1)
            lr1r2[r1].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:12::1/64"))
            lr1r2[r2].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:12::2/64"))

            lr1r3 = self.addLink(r1, r3, igp_cost=5)
            lr1r3[r1].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:13::1/64"))
            lr1r3[r3].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:13::3/64"))

            lr2r3 = self.addLink(r2, r3, igp_cost=3)
            lr2r3[r2].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:23::2/64"))
            lr2r3[r3].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:23::3/64"))

            lr1a = self.addLink(r1, a, igp_passive=True)
            lr1a[r1].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:1::1/64"))
            lr1a[a].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:1::A/64"))

            lr3b = self.addLink(r3, b, igp_passive=True)
            lr3b[r3].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:3::3/64"))
            lr3b[b].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:3::B/64"))

            super(MyTopology, self).build(*args, **kwargs)


The code is very simple as by default IPMininet_ enables OSPF on routers. We introduce two specific parameters. First, the interface that connects a router to a host is flagged as a passive interface (``igp_passive=True``). This indicates to the router that there are no other routers attached to this interface and that it should not send or accept OSPF Hello messages on this interface. The second configuration parameter is that we set the IGP cost on each link.


We use this mininet_ topology to collect packet traces that show the packets that OSPF routers exchange. For this, we add the following ``post_build`` method that IPMininet_ starts after having constructed the network and before launching the daemons. It simply starts tcpdump_ on each router to collect the first 100 OSPF packets that they send/receive.

.. code-block:: python

    def post_build(self, net):
        for r in self.routers():
            command="/usr/sbin/tcpdump --immediate-mode -c 100 -w ./"+r+"-trace.pcap proto ospf"
            p = net[r].popen(shlex.split(command))

        super(MyTopology, self).post_build(net)

Finally, we can start the IPMininet_ topology and launch the daemons. The entire script is available from :download:`/exercises/ipmininet_scripts/ospf6.py`.

.. code-block:: python

    net = IPNet(topo=MyTopology(), allocate_IPs=False)  # Disable IP auto-allocation
    try:
        net.start()
        IPCLI(net)
    finally:
        net.stop()


The script starts the routers and hosts.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> nodes
   available nodes are:
   a b r1 r2 r3
   mininet> links
   r1-eth2<->a-eth0 (OK OK)
   r1-eth0<->r2-eth0 (OK OK)
   r1-eth1<->r3-eth0 (OK OK)
   r2-eth1<->r3-eth1 (OK OK)
   r3-eth2<->b-eth0 (OK OK)

We can easily verify that the paths used to forward packets are the expected ones according to the configured IGP weights.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> a traceroute6 2001:db8:1341:3::B
   traceroute to 2001:db8:1341:3::B (2001:db8:1341:3::b) from 2001:db8:1341:1::a, 30 hops max, 24 byte packets

   1  2001:db8:1341:3::3 (2001:db8:1341:3::3)  0.088 ms  0.19 ms  0.053 ms

We can also connect to the OSPFv3 daemon running on the routers to observe its state. For this, we use the ``noecho r1 telnet localhost ospf6d`` command.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> noecho r1 telnet localhost ospf6d
   Trying ::1...
   Connected to localhost.
   Escape character is '^]'.

   Password:

The password to access this daemon is `zebra`. It supports various commands that are described in the `FRRouting documentation <http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/ospf6d.html#showing-ospf6-information>`_ We briefly illustrate some of them below.

.. code-block:: console

The ``show ipv6 ospf6`` command reports the general state of the OSPFv3 daemon.
The ``show ipv6 ospf6 neighbor`` command reports the state of the connected neighbors.

.. code-block:: console

    r1> show ipv6 ospf6 neighbor
    Neighbor ID     Pri    DeadTime    State/IfState         Duration I/F[State]
    0.0.0.3          10    00:00:02     Full/DR              14:44:44 r1-eth0[BDR]

In its output, we see that ``r1`` is attached to two different routers. Finally, the ``show ipv6 ospf6 database`` returns the full OSPFv3 database with all the link state information that was distributed by OSPFv3.

.. code-block:: console

We can also use the packet traces that were collected by tcpdump_ to observe the packets that the OSPFv3 daemons exchange. OSPFv3 is a more complex protocol that the basic link state protocol that we have described in this book, but you should be able to understand some of these packets. The packet traces are available as :download:`/exercises/traces/ospf6-r1-trace.pcap`, :download:`/exercises/traces/ospf6-r2-trace.pcap` and :download:`/exercises/traces/ospf6-r3-trace.pcap`. Here are a few interesting packets collected on router ``r1``.

The first packet that this router received his a Hello packet that was sent by router ``r2``. There are several interesting points to note about this packet. First, its source address is the link-local address (``fe80::68bc:b4ff:fe19:42b7``) of router ``r2`` on this interface. The destination address of the packet is reserved IPv6 multicast address for OSPFv3, i.e. ``ff02::5``. The Hop Limit of the packet is set to 1 and OSFPv3 uses a next header of type 89.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ospf6-packet1.png

The Hello packet contains some parameters such as the `Hello interval` that is set to 1 second. This interval is the delay between the transmission of successive Hello packets. Since the `Router Dead Interval` is set to 3 seconds, the router will consider the link as down if it does not receive Hello packets during a period of 3 seconds. The second packet of the trace is sent by router ``r1``.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ospf6-packet2.png

We can then observe the Database description packet that is sent by routers to announce the state of their OSPFv3 database. The details of this packet are beyond the scope of this simple exercise.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ospf6-packet3.png

This packet is updated when new information is added in the router's OSPFv3 database. A few seconds router, this router sends another Database description packet that announces more information.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ospf6-packet4.png

Router ``r2`` reacts to this updated Database description packet by requesting the link state information that it does not already know. For this, it sends a `LS Request` packet.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ospf6-packet5.png

The requested information is sent in a `LS Update` packet shortly after that.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ospf6-packet6.png

OSPFv3 also includes `LS Acknowledge` packets that acknowledge the correct reception of link state information.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ospf6-packet7.png

A more detailed discussion of the packets that routing protocols exchange may be found in [Goralski2009]_.

Exploring RIP
-------------

IPMininet_ can also be used to perform experiments with RIP. A simple script that uses RIPng is provided below.

.. code-block:: python

    import shlex
    from ipmininet.iptopo import IPTopo
    from ipmininet.router.config import RIPng, RouterConfig
    from ipmininet.ipnet import IPNet
    from ipmininet.cli import IPCLI

    class MyTopology(IPTopo):

        def build(self, *args, **kwargs):

            # RouterConfig ensures that OSPF is not automatically started
            r1 = self.addRouter("r1", config=RouterConfig)
            r2 = self.addRouter("r2", config=RouterConfig)
            r3 = self.addRouter("r3", config=RouterConfig)
            a = self.addHost("a")
            b = self.addHost("b")

            lr1r2 = self.addLink(r1, r2, igp_cost=1)
            lr1r2[r1].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:12::1/64"))
            lr1r2[r2].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:12::2/64"))

            lr1r3 = self.addLink(r1, r3, igp_cost=5)
            lr1r3[r1].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:13::1/64"))
            lr1r3[r3].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:13::3/64"))

            lr2r3 = self.addLink(r2, r3, igp_cost=3)
            lr2r3[r2].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:23::2/64"))
            lr2r3[r3].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:23::3/64"))

            lr1a = self.addLink(r1, a)
            lr1a[r1].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:1::1/64"))
            lr1a[a].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:1::A/64"))

            lr3b = self.addLink(r3, b)
            lr3b[r3].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:3::3/64"))
            lr3b[b].addParams(ip=("2001:db8:1341:3::B/64"))


            r1.addDaemon(RIPng)
            r2.addDaemon(RIPng)
            r3.addDaemon(RIPng)

            super(MyTopology, self).build(*args, **kwargs)

        def post_build(self, net):
            for r in self.routers():
                command = "/usr/sbin/tcpdump --immediate-mode -c 10 -w ./ripng-"+r+"-trace.pcap udp port 521"
                p = net[r].popen(shlex.split(command))

        super(MyTopology, self).post_build(net)

    net = IPNet(topo=MyTopology(), allocate_IPs=False)  # Disable IP auto-allocation
    try:
        net.start()
        IPCLI(net)
    finally:
        net.stop()

As RIP messages are exchanged using UDP on port 521, we filter this port in the tcpdump_ trace. RIPng distributes the routes and our two hosts can exchange packets. The entire script is available from :download:`/exercises/ipmininet_scripts/ripng.py`.

We can observe the RIPng messages that are exchanged over the network. :rfc:`2080` defines two types of RIPng messages:

 - the requests
 - the responses that contain the router's routing table

When a router starts, it sends a request message. This is illustrated in the figure below with the first message sent by router ``r2``. This message is sent inside an IPv6 packet whose source address is the link-local address of the router and the destination address is ``ff02::9`` which is the reserved multicast address for RIPng.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ripng-packet1.png

Router ``r2`` receives a similar request from ``fe80::481a:48ff:fed7:292e`` and replies by sending its routing table in a response message. Note that this message is sent to the link-local address of the requesting router.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ripng-packet2.png

Later, router ``r2`` will regularly transmit its distance vector inside an unsolicited response message that is sent towards the IPv6 multicast address ``ff02::9``.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/ripng-packet2.png

The packet traces collected on the three routers of this example are available from :download:`/exercises/traces/ripng-r1-trace.pcap`, :download:`/exercises/traces/ripng-r2-trace.pcap` and :download:`/exercises/traces/ripng-r3-trace.pcap`.


Exploring BGP
-------------

To explore the configuration of BGP, let us consider a network that contains three ASes: ``AS1``,  ``AS2`` and ``AS3``. To simplify the tests, we identify one host inside each of these ASes.

     .. tikz:: A simple Internet
        :libs: shapes, positioning, matrix, arrows, shapes

        \tikzstyle{arrow} = [thick,->,>=stealth]

        \tikzset{host/.style = {circle, draw, text centered, minimum height=2em}, }
        \tikzset{ftable/.style={rectangle, dashed, draw} }
	\tikzset{as/.style={cloud, draw,cloud puffs=10,cloud puff arc=120, aspect=2, minimum height=1em, minimum width=1em} }

        \node[host] (h1) {h1};
        \node[as, right=of h1] (AS1) {AS1};
        \node[as, right=of AS1] (AS2) {AS2};
	\node[host, right=of AS2] (h2) {h2};
        \node[as, below right=of AS1] (AS3) {AS3};

	% hosts
	\path[draw, color=black]
	(AS1) edge (h1)
	(AS2) edge (h2)
	(AS3) edge (h3);



.. code-block:: python

    import ipmininet.router.config.bgp as _bgp
    from ipmininet.iptopo import IPTopo
    from ipmininet.router.config import BGP, ebgp_session, AF_INET6, CLIENT_PROVIDER, SHARE

    from ipmininet.ipnet import IPNet
    from ipmininet.cli import IPCLI

    class MyTopology(IPTopo):
        """Creates a very simple interdomain topology"""
        def build(self, *args, **kwargs):
            """
            AS1 --$--> AS2 --$--> AS3
             |                     |
             +-----------=---------+
            """
            # The remaining code snippets go here

As in the previous examples, we create the routers and associate one IPv6 prefix to each AS:

 - ``AS1`` is assigned ``2001:cafe:1::/48``
 - ``AS2`` is assigned ``2001:cafe:2::/48``
 - ``AS3`` is assigned ``2001:cafe:3::/48``

.. code-block:: python

   # Add all routers
   as1 = self.addRouter('as1')
   as2 = self.addRouter('as2')
   as3 = self.addRouter('as3')

   routers=self.routers()
   prefix = {routers[i]: '2001:cafe:%04x::/48' % (i+1) for i in range(len(routers ))}

   as1.addDaemon(BGP, address_families=(AF_INET6(networks=(prefix[as1],)),))
   as2.addDaemon(BGP, address_families=(AF_INET6(networks=(prefix[as2],)),))
   as3.addDaemon(BGP, address_families=(AF_INET6(networks=(prefix[as3],)),))

The `addDaemon` method adds a BGP daemon on each router and configures it to advertise the IPv6 prefix allocated to this AS. We then create all the links and manually assign one IPv6 subnet to each link and one IPv6 address to each interface. For the interdomain links, we use an IPv6 prefix that belongs to one of the attached ASes.

.. code-block:: python

	# Add hosts

        h1= self.addHost("h1")
        h2= self.addHost("h2")
        h3= self.addHost("h3")


        # Add all links
        l12=self.addLink(as1, as2)
        l12[as1].addParams(ip="2001:cafe:1:12::1/64")
        l12[as2].addParams(ip="2001:cafe:1:12::2/64")

        l13=self.addLink(as1, as3)
        l13[as1].addParams(ip="2001:cafe:1:13::1/64")
        l13[as3].addParams(ip="2001:cafe:1:13::3/64")
        l23=self.addLink(as2, as3)
        l23[as2].addParams(ip="2001:cafe:2:23::2/64")
        l23[as3].addParams(ip="2001:cafe:2:23::3/64")

        # Links to the hosts
        las1h1 = self.addLink(as1, h1)
        las1h1[as1].addParams(ip=("2001:cafe:1:1::1/64"))
        las1h1[h1].addParams(ip=("2001:cafe:1:1::11/64"))

        las2h2 = self.addLink(as2, h2)
        las2h2[as2].addParams(ip=("2001:cafe:2:1::2/64"))
        las2h2[h2].addParams(ip=("2001:cafe:2:1::12/64"))

        las3h3 = self.addLink(as3, h3)
        las3h3[as3].addParams(ip=("2001:cafe:3:1::3/64"))
        las3h3[h3].addParams(ip=("2001:cafe:3:1::13/64"))


The last step is to specify to which AS each router belongs and to configure the eBGP sessions and their routing policies. IPMininet_ abstracts most of the complexity of the configuration of these policies by supporting two policies

.. code-block:: python

        # Set AS-ownerships
        self.addAS(1, (as1,))
        self.addAS(2, (as2,))
        self.addAS(3, (as3,))

        # Add eBGP sessions
	# AS1 is a client of AS2
        ebgp_session(self, as1, as2, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)
	# AS2 is a client of AS3
        ebgp_session(self, as2, as3, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)
	# AS1 and AS3 are shared cost peers
        ebgp_session(self, as1, as3, link_type=SHARE)

        super(MyTopology, self).build(*args, **kwargs)

The script ends by launching the full topology. The entire script is available from :download:`/exercises/ipmininet_scripts/ebgp-simple.py`.

We can now run this simple network.

.. code-block:: console

   sudo python3 ebgp-simple.py

If you launch the script and immediately type ``ping6all`` to check the connectivity, you might obtained the following result.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> ping6all
   *** Ping: testing reachability over IPv6
   h1 --IPv6--> X X
   h2 --IPv6--> X X
   h3 --IPv6--> X X
   *** Results: 100% dropped (0/6 received)

Remember that BGP is a distributed protocol and that it takes some time to launch the daemons and exchange the messages. After some time, the same command will confirm that everything works as expected.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> ping6all
   *** Ping: testing reachability over IPv6
   h1 --IPv6--> h2 h3
   h2 --IPv6--> h1 h3
   h3 --IPv6--> h2 h1
   *** Results: 0% dropped (6/6 received)

We can also use :manpage:`traceroute6(8)` to check the path followed by the packets. Before doing that, think about the configuration of the BGP routing policies and try to predict the output of :manpage:`traceroute6(8)`. This is a good exercise to check your understanding of BGP.

We have configured the following addresses on the hosts.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> h1 ip -6 -o addr show
   1: lo    inet6 ::1/128 scope host \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   2: h1-eth0    inet6 2001:cafe:1:1::11/64 scope global \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   2: h1-eth0    inet6 fe80::8ae:b0ff:fe9d:aefa/64 scope link \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   mininet> h2 ip -6 -o addr show
   1: lo    inet6 ::1/128 scope host \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   2: h2-eth0    inet6 2001:cafe:2:1::12/64 scope global \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   2: h2-eth0    inet6 fe80::d8a3:cdff:fed6:14ad/64 scope link \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   mininet> h3 ip -6 -o addr show
   1: lo    inet6 ::1/128 scope host \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   2: h3-eth0    inet6 2001:cafe:3:1::13/64 scope global \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   2: h3-eth0    inet6 fe80::101d:e1ff:fe4e:a3a9/64 scope link \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

We can now explore the routes in this small Internet. Host ``h1`` can reach directly host ``h3``.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> h1 traceroute6 -n 2001:cafe:3:1::13
   traceroute to 2001:cafe:3:1::13 (2001:cafe:3:1::13) from 2001:cafe:1:1::11, 30 hops max, 24 byte packets
   1  2001:cafe:1:1::1  0.099 ms  0.038 ms  0.056 ms
   2  2001:cafe:2:23::3  2.3 ms  0.135 ms  0.161 ms
   3  2001:cafe:3:1::13  0.216 ms  0.182 ms  0.187 ms

Note that the path preferred by ``AS3`` to reach ``AS1`` is different.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> h3 traceroute6 -n 2001:cafe:1:1::11
   traceroute to 2001:cafe:1:1::11 (2001:cafe:1:1::11) from 2001:cafe:3:1::13, 30 hops max, 24 byte packets
   1  2001:cafe:3:1::3  0.133 ms  0.088 ms  0.078 ms
   2  2001:cafe:2:23::2  0.099 ms  0.085 ms  0.086 ms

   4  2001:cafe:1:1::11  0.075 ms  0.037 ms  0.062 ms


The same applies for the paths between ``h1`` and ``h2``

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> h1 traceroute6 -n 2001:cafe:2:1::12
   traceroute to 2001:cafe:2:1::12 (2001:cafe:2:1::12) from 2001:cafe:1:1::11, 30 hops max, 24 byte packets

Besides :manpage:`ping6(8)` and :manpage:`traceroute6(8)`, it is also useful to interact with the BGP daemon that runs on each of our routers. This is done by connecting on the Command Line Interface of the BGP router using telnet.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> noecho as1 telnet localhost bgpd
   Trying ::1...
   Connected to localhost.

   Quagga

The password for the BGP daemon is `zebra`. The `noecho` command indicates that mininet_ does not need to echo the characters that you type. You then enter the Quagga VTY that enables you to type commands. The `help` commands gives you some information about the available commands as well as `?`.

.. code-block:: console

   as1> help
   Quagga VTY provides advanced help feature.  When you need help,
   anytime at the command line please press '?'.

   If nothing matches, the help list will be empty and you must backup
   until entering a '?' shows the available options.
   Two styles of help are provided:
   1. Full help is available when you are ready to enter a
      command argument (e.g. 'show ?') and describes each possible
      argument.
   2. Partial help is provided when an abbreviated argument is entered
      and you want to know what arguments match the input
      (e.g. 'show me?'.)

   as1>
   enable    Turn on privileged mode command

In these exercises, we mainly consider the ``show`` that extracts information from the BGP daemon. We type `show bgp` and press the `tabulation` key to see the available commands in the `show bgp`.

   Keepalive

This router (`as1`) has two BGP neighbors: ``2001:cafe:1:12::2`` and ``2001:cafe:1:13::3``. Both BGP sessions are established using the current version of the protocol (version 4). About 50 messages were sent/received over each session. These messages are mainly the BGP Keepalive messages that are exchanged every 30 seconds. The last column indicates that two prefixes were received over each session. We can see more details about these two eBGP sessions with the `show bgp neighbors` command.

   Displayed  3 routes and 5 total paths


It is interesting to look at the output of this command in details. Router `as1` has routes for three different IPv6 prefixes. The first prefix is its own prefix, ``2001:cafe:1::/48``. It has no nexthop since this prefix is originated by the router. Then, `as1` has received two paths for ``2001:cafe:2::/48``. In the BGP Loc-RIB, the `>` character indicates the best route according to the BGP decision process.  ``2001:cafe:2::/48`` was learned over two different BGP sessions:

 - the eBGP session with ``fe80::3c81:2eff:fe19:465d`` with an AS-Path of ``AS3:AS2`` (see last column)
 - the eBGP session with ``fe80::c001:dcff:fe49:a512`` with an AS-Path of ``AS2`` (see last column)

The first of these two routes is preferred as indicated by the `>` character because it has a higher ``local-preference` (150) than the second one (100). For prefix ``2001:cafe:3::/48``, the route learned via ``fe80::3c81:2eff:fe19:465d`` is also preferred for the same reason.

IPMininet_ also allows to explore the dynamics of BGP by looking at the packets that the routers exchange. For this, we slightly modify the example above and add delays to the interdomain links as follows.

.. code-block:: python

   l12=self.addLink(as1, as2, delay='10ms')
   l13=self.addLink(as1, as3, delay='10ms')
   l23=self.addLink(as2, as3, delay='200ms')


We also add a ``post_build`` method to launch tcpdump_ and capture the BGP packets exchanged by the routers. A BGP session runs over a TCP connection. Let us examine a few of the BGP messages exchanged on the BGP session between ``AS1`` and ``AS2``. The traces collected on the three routers are available from :download:`/exercises/traces/bgp-as1-trace.pcap`, :download:`/exercises/traces/bgp-as2-trace.pcap` and :download:`/exercises/traces/bgp-as2-trace.pcap`.

The BGP session starts with a TCP three-way handshake.
Once the session has been established, both BGP daemons send an ``OPEN`` message describing their capabilities and the BGP extensions that it supports. The details of these extensions go beyond the scope of this book. However, it is important to note that the ``OPEN`` message contains the ``AS`` number of the router that sends the message and its identifier as a 32 bits IPv4 address. This router identifier uniquely identifies the router. The last mandatory parameter of the ``OPEN`` message is the `Hold Time`, i.e. the maximum delay between two successive messages over this BGP session. A BGP router should send ``KEEPALIVE`` messages every one third of the `Hold Time` to keep the session up.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/bgp-packet2.png

The ``UPDATE`` message can be used to withdraw and advertise routes. The packet below is sent by ``AS2`` to advertise its route towards `2001:cafe:2::/48` on the BGP session with ``AS1``.

.. figure:: /exercises/figures/bgp-packet2.png


Another interesting utilization of IPMininet_ is to explore how routers react to link failures. We start from the same network as with the previous example and disable the link between ``AS2`` and ``AS3``. For this, we log on one of the two routers and issue the following commands.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> noecho as2 telnet localhost bgpd
   Trying ::1...
   Connected to localhost.
   Escape character is '^]'.

We first connect to the BGP daemon on router `as2`. In addition to the `show` commands that have been described earlier, the router also supports privileged commands that can change its configuration. Before executing these commands, we must enter the privileged mode with the `enable` command. On production routers, this command requires a password to verify the credentials of the network administrator. The `#` prompt indicates that we are allowed to execute privileged commands. We first check the state of the BGP sessions with the `show bgp summary` commands. There are two BGP sessions configured on this router.

We can now disable one of the BGP sessions on router `as2` as follows.

.. code-block:: console

   as2# configure terminal
   as2(config)# router bgp 2
   as2(config-router)# neighbor 2001:cafe:2:23::3 shutdown
   as2(config-router)# exit
   as2(config)# exit


We start indicate that we will use the terminal to change the router configuration with `configure terminal`. We then enter the BGP part of the configuration with `router bgp 2` (`2` is the AS number of `as2`). Then we use the `neighbor 2001:cafe:2:23::3 shutdown` that takes as parameter the IP address of the peer of the session that we want to stop. We then leave the BGP part of the configuration (first `exit`) and the configuration menu (second `exit` command). At this point, the BGP session between ``AS2`` and ``AS3`` is down.

.. code-block:: console

   as2# show bgp summary

Without a BGP session between ``AS2`` and ``AS3``, there are reachability problems in this simple Internet.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> ping6all

   h1 --IPv6--> h2 h3
   h2 --IPv6--> X h1
   h3 --IPv6--> X h1
   *** Results: 33% dropped (4/6 received)

We can fix them by enabling again the BGP session with the `no neighbor 2001:cafe:2:23::3 shutdown` command.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> noecho as2 telnet localhost bgpd
   Trying ::1...

Exercises
---------

We can use IPMininet_ to prepare some networks with problems that need to be analyzed and corrected.

1. Our first example is a small Internet with 5 ASes. A subset of the script that configures this network is shown below. There is one host attached to each AS and this host has the same number as its AS. The entire script is available from :download:`/exercises/ipmininet_scripts/ebgp-bug.py`.

   .. code-block:: python

        l12=self.addLink(as1, as2, delay='10ms')
        l13=self.addLink(as1, as3, delay='10ms')
        l23=self.addLink(as2, as3, delay='10ms')
        l15=self.addLink(as1, as5, delay='10ms')
        l24=self.addLink(as2, as4, delay='10ms')
        l34=self.addLink(as3, as4, delay='10ms')
        l45=self.addLink(as4, as5, delay='10ms')

        # Add eBGP sessions
        ebgp_session(self, as2, as1, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)
        ebgp_session(self, as3, as1, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)
        ebgp_session(self, as5, as1, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)
        ebgp_session(self, as3, as4, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)

        ebgp_session(self, as2, as3, link_type=SHARE)
        ebgp_session(self, as2, as4, link_type=SHARE)
        ebgp_session(self, as4, as5, link_type=SHARE)


 When this network is launched, `ping6all` reports connectivity problems. Hosts `h1` and `h4` cannot exchange packets. Can you fix the problem by changing the routing policy used on only one interdomain link ? Justify your answer

 .. code-block:: console

    mininet> ping6all
    *** Ping: testing reachability over IPv6
    h1 --IPv6--> h2 h5 X h3
    h2 --IPv6--> h3 h1 h4 h5
    h3 --IPv6--> h2 h1 h4 h5
    h4 --IPv6--> h2 X h5 h3
    h5 --IPv6--> h2 h1 h4 h3
    *** Results: 10% dropped (18/20 received)

2. Another interesting utilization IPMininet_ is to explore the impact of a link failure. We start from a small variant of the above topology.

 .. code-block:: python

    l12=self.addLink(as1, as2, delay='10ms')
    l13=self.addLink(as1, as3, delay='10ms')
    l23=self.addLink(as2, as3, delay='10ms')
    l15=self.addLink(as1, as5, delay='10ms')
    l24=self.addLink(as2, as4, delay='10ms')
    l34=self.addLink(as3, as4, delay='10ms')
    l45=self.addLink(as4, as5, delay='10ms')
    l25=self.addLink(as2, as5, delay='10ms')
    # Add eBGP sessions
    ebgp_session(self, as2, as1, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)
    ebgp_session(self, as3, as1, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)
    ebgp_session(self, as5, as1, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)
    ebgp_session(self, as4, as3, link_type=CLIENT_PROVIDER)

    ebgp_session(self, as2, as3, link_type=SHARE)
    ebgp_session(self, as2, as4, link_type=SHARE)
    ebgp_session(self, as4, as5, link_type=SHARE)
    ebgp_session(self, as2, as5, link_type=SHARE)

When this network starts, all hosts can reach all other hosts.

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> ping6all
   *** Ping: testing reachability over IPv6
   h1 --IPv6--> h4 h3 h2 h5

5. Let us now consider another example, also implemented using an IPMininet_ script. The network contains eight ASes with one host per AS. This small Internet is shown below and the script is available from :download:`/exercises/ipmininet_scripts/ebgp-bug-3.py`.


     .. tikz:: A simple Internet

        \tikzset{host/.style = {circle, draw, text centered, minimum height=2em}, }
        \tikzset{ftable/.style={rectangle, dashed, draw} }
	\tikzset{as/.style={cloud, draw,cloud puffs=10,cloud puff arc=120, aspect=2, minimum height=1em, minimum width=1em} }

        \node[as] (AS1) {AS1};

	\node[as, right=of AS5] (AS6) {AS6};
	\node[as, right=of AS7] (AS8) {AS8};
