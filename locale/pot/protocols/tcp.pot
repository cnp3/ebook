This made the ISN predictable and caused a security issue. The typical security problem was the following. Consider a server that trusts a host based on its IP address and allows the system administrator to log in from this host without giving a password [#frlogin]_. Consider now an attacker who knows this particular configuration and is able to send IP packets having the client's address as source. He can send fake TCP segments to the server, but does not receive the server's answers. If he can predict the `ISN` that is chosen by the server, he can send a fake `SYN` segment and shortly after the fake `ACK` segment confirming the reception of the `SYN+ACK` segment sent by the server. Once the TCP connection is open, he can use it to send any command to the server. To counter this attack, current TCP implementations add randomness to the `ISN`. One of the solutions, proposed in :rfc:`1948` is to compute the `ISN` as ::"

This method allows the server to use different ISNs for different clients at the same time. `Measurements <http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/newtcp/>`_ performed with the first implementations of this technique showed that it was difficult to implement it correctly, but today's TCP implementation now generate good ISNs."

There may be no server process that is listening on the destination port of the `SYN` segment. The server could always refuse connection establishments from this particular client (e.g. due to security reasons) or the server may not have enough resources to accept a new TCP connection at that time. In this case, the server would reply with a TCP segment having its `RST` flag set and containing the `sequence number` of the received `SYN` segment incremented by one as its `acknowledgment number`. This is illustrated in the figure below. We discuss the other usages of the TCP `RST` flag later (see :ref:`TCPRelease`)."

Then, it replies with an `ACK` segment and enters the `Established` state where data can be exchanged. On the other hand, a server host starts in the `Init` state. When a server process starts to listen to a destination port, the underlying TCP entity creates a TCP control block and a queue to process incoming `SYN` segments. Upon reception of a `SYN` segment, the server's TCP entity replies with a `SYN+ACK` and enters the `SYN RCVD` state. It remains in this state until it receives an `ACK` segment that acknowledges its `SYN+ACK` segment, with this it then enters the `Established` state."

Upon reception of the `SYN` segment sent by the other host, they reply by sending a `SYN+ACK` segment and enter the `SYN RCVD` state.

msgid "When a TCP entity opens a TCP connection, it creates a Transmission Control Block (:term:`TCB`). The TCB contains the entire state that is maintained by the TCP entity for each TCP connection. During connection establishment, the TCB contains the local IP address, the remote IP address, the local port number, the remote port number, the current local sequence number and the last sequence number received from the remote entity. Until the mid 1990s, TCP implementations had a limit on the number of TCP connections that could be in the `SYN RCVD` state at a given time. Many implementations set this limit to about 100 TCBs. This limit was considered sufficient even for heavily load http servers given the small delay between the reception of a `SYN` segment and the reception of the `ACK` segment that terminates the establishment of the TCP connection. When the limit of 100 TCBs in the `SYN Rcvd` state is reached, the TCP entity discards all received TCP `SYN` segments that do not correspond to an existing TCB."
msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/tcp.rst:194
msgid "This limit of 100 TCBs in the `SYN Rcvd` state was chosen to protect the TCP entity from the risk of overloading its memory with too many TCBs in the `SYN Rcvd` state. However, it was also the reason for a new type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack :rfc:`4987`. A DoS attack is defined as an attack where an attacker can render a resource unavailable in the network. For example, an attacker may cause a DoS attack on a 2 Mbps link used by a company by sending more than 2 Mbps of packets through this link. In this case, the DoS attack was more subtle. As a TCP entity discards all received `SYN` segments as soon as it has 100 TCBs in the `SYN Rcvd` state, an attacker simply had to send a few 100 `SYN` segments every second to a server and never reply to the received `SYN+ACK` segments. To avoid being caught, attackers were of course sending these `SYN` segments with a different address than their own IP address [#fspoofing]_. On most TCP implementations, once a TCB entered the `SYN Rcvd` state, it remained in this state for several seconds, waiting for a retransmission of the initial `SYN` segment. This attack was later called a `SYN flood` attack and the servers of the ISP named panix were among the first to `be affected <http://memex.org/meme2-12.html>`_ by this attack."

Instead, they reply directly with a `SYN+ACK` segment and wait until the reception of a valid `ACK`. This implementation trick is only possible if the TCP implementation is able to verify that the received `ACK` segment acknowledges the `SYN+ACK` segment sent earlier without storing the initial sequence number of this `SYN+ACK` segment in a TCB. The solution to solve this problem, which is known as `SYN cookies <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>`_ is to compute the 32 bits of the `ISN` as follows :"

The MSS is the size of the largest segment that a TCP entity is able to process. According to :rfc:`879`, all TCP implementations must be able to receive TCP segments containing 536 bytes of payload. However, most TCP implementations are able to process larger segments. Such TCP implementations use the TCP MSS Option in the `SYN`/`SYN+ACK` segment to indicate the largest segment they are able to process. The MSS value indicates the maximum size of the payload of the TCP segments. The client (resp. server) stores in its :term:`TCB` the MSS value announced by the server (resp. the client)."

For example, consider :rfc:`1323` (which is discussed in :ref:`TCPReliable`). :rfc:`1323` defines TCP extensions to support timestamps and larger windows. If the client supports :rfc:`1323`, it adds a :rfc:`1323` option to its `SYN` segment. If the server understands this :rfc:`1323` option and wishes to use it, it replies with a :rfc:`1323` option in the `SYN+ACK` segment and the extension defined in :rfc:`1323` is used throughout the TCP connection. Otherwise, if the server's `SYN+ACK` does not contain the :rfc:`1323` option, the client is not allowed to use this extension and the corresponding TCP header options throughout the TCP connection.

This is a huge overhead that is not acceptable in wide area networks. A second simple solution would be to only transmit a new TCP segment once the user has produced MSS bytes of data. This solution reduces the overhead, but at the cost of a potentially very high delay."

If the same segment is retransmitted several times, the retransmission timeout is doubled after every retransmission until it reaches a configured maximum. :rfc:`2988` suggests a maximum retransmission timeout of at least 60 seconds.

However, few application layer protocols exchange data in both directions at the same time and thus this method rarely works. For an application that is sending data segments in one direction only, the remote TCP entity returns empty TCP segments whose only useful information is their acknowledgment number. This may cause a large overhead in wide area network if a pure `ACK` segment is sent in response to each received data segment. Most TCP implementations use a `delayed acknowledgment` strategy. This strategy ensures that piggybacking is used whenever possible, otherwise pure `ACK` segments are sent for every second received data segments when there are no losses. When there are losses or reordering, `ACK` segments are more important for the sender and they are sent immediately :rfc:`813` :rfc:`1122`.

A TCP sender can only remove data from its sending buffer once they have been acknowledged by TCP's cumulative acknowledgments. This design was chosen for two reasons. First, it allows the receiver to discard parts of its receiving buffer when it is running out of memory without loosing data. Second, as the SACK option is not transmitted reliably, the cumulative acknowledgments are still required to deal with losses of `ACK` segments carrying only SACK information.

In this case, the remote workstation \"authenticated\" the client host based on its IP address. This was a bad practice from a security viewpoint."
