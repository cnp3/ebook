msgid "Consider a `b` bits per second link between two hosts that has a propagation delay of `t` seconds. Derive a formula that computes the time elapsed between the transmission of the first bit of a `d` bytes segment from a sending host and the reception of the last bit of this segment on the receiving host."

msgid "Transmission links have sometimes different upstream and downstream bandwidths. A typical example are access networks that use ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines). Consider two hosts connected via an ADSL link having an upstream bandwidth of 1 Mbps and a downstream bandwidth of 50 Mbps. The propagation delay between the two hosts is 10 milliseconds. What is the maximum throughput, expressed in frames/second, that the alternating bit protocol can obtain on this link if each data frame has a length of 125 bytes and acknowledgments are 25 bytes long. Same question if the protocol is modified to support 1500 bytes long data frames."

msgid "Checksums and CRCs should not be confused with secure hash functions such as MD5 defined in :rfc:`1321` or SHA-1 described in :rfc:`4634`. Secure hash functions are used to ensure that files or sometimes packets/segments have not been modified. Secure hash functions aim at detecting malicious changes while checksums and CRCs only detect random transmission errors. Use the `shasum <http://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum>`_ or `md5sum <http://linux.die.net/man/1/md5sum>`_ programs on Linux to perform the same tests as above."
