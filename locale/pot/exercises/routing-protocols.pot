msgid "Routing protocols play a key role in the Internet since they ensure that all the routers have valid routing tables. In this section, we use IPMininet_ to explore how intradomain and interdomain routing protocols work in practice. IPMininet_ adds an abstraction layer above the actual configuration of the FRRouting daemons that implement these routing protocols."

msgid "Exploring OSPF"
msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/routing-protocols.rst:15
msgid "We first use IPMininet_ to explore the operation of OSPFv3, the version of OSPF that supports IPv6. We create a simple network with three routers and two hosts as shown in the figure below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/routing-protocols.rst:80
msgid "The code is very simple as by default IPMininet_ enables OSPF on routers. We introduce two specific parameters. First, the interface that connects a router to a host is flagged as a passive interface (``igp_passive=True``). This indicates to the router that there are no other routers attached to this interface and that it should not send or accept OSPF Hello messages on this interface. The second configuration parameter is that we set the IGP cost on each link."
msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/routing-protocols.rst:83
msgid "We use this mininet_ topology to collect packet traces that show the packets that OSPF routers exchange. For this, we add the following ``post_build`` method that IPMininet_ starts after having constructed the network and before launching the daemons. It simply starts tcpdump_ on each router to collect the first 100 OSPF packets that they send/receive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/routing-protocols.rst:94

msgid "We can also use the packet traces that were collected by tcpdump_ to observe the packets that the OSPFv3 daemons exchange. OSPFv3 is a more complex protocol that the basic link state protocol that we have described in this book, but you should be able to understand some of these packets. The packet traces are available as :download:`/exercises/traces/ospf6-r1-trace.pcap`, :download:`/exercises/traces/ospf6-r2-trace.pcap` and :download:`/exercises/traces/ospf6-r3-trace.pcap`.

First, its source address is the link-local address (``fe80::68bc:b4ff:fe19:42b7``) of router ``r2`` on this interface. The destination address of the packet is reserved IPv6 multicast address for OSPFv3, i.e. ``ff02::5``. The Hop Limit of the packet is set to 1 and OSFPv3 uses a next header of type 89."
msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/routing-protocols.rst:245
msgid "The Hello packet contains some parameters such as the `Hello interval` that is set to 1 second. This interval is the delay between the transmission of successive Hello packets. Since the `Router Dead Interval` is set to 3 seconds, the router will consider the link as down if it does not receive Hello packets during a period of 3 seconds. The second packet of the trace is sent by router ``r1``."

The details of these extensions go beyond the scope of this book. However, it is important to note that the ``OPEN`` message contains the ``AS`` number of the router that sends the message and its identifier as a 32 bits IPv4 address. This router identifier uniquely identifies the router. The last mandatory parameter of the ``OPEN`` message is the `Hold Time`, i.e. the maximum delay between two successive messages over this BGP session.
