msgid "In the late 1980s, high energy physicists working at CERN_ had to efficiently exchange documents about their ongoing and planned experiments. `Tim Berners-Lee`_ evaluated several of the documents sharing techniques that were available at that time [B1989]_. As none of the existing solutions met CERN's requirements, they chose to develop a completely new document sharing system. This system was initially called the `mesh`. It was quickly renamed the `world wide web`. The starting point for the `world wide web` are hypertext documents. An hypertext document is a document that contains references (hyperlinks) to other documents that the reader can immediately access. Hypertext was not invented for the world wide web. The idea of hypertext documents was proposed in 1945 [Bush1945]_ and the first experiments were done during the 1960s [Nelson1965]_ [Myers1998]_ . Compared to the hypertext documents that were used in the late 1980s, the main innovation introduced by the `world wide web` was to allow hyperlinks to reference documents stored on different remote machines."

msgid "Open standards play a key role in the success of the `world wide web` as we know it today. Without open standards, the world wide web would have never reached its current size. In addition to open standards, another important factor for the success of the web was the availability of open and efficient implementations of these standards. When CERN started to work on the `web`, their objective was to build a running system that could be used by physicists. They developed open-source implementations of the `first web servers <http://www.w3.org/Daemon/>`_ and `web clients <http://www.w3.org/Library/Activity.html>`_. These open-source implementations were powerful and could be used as is, by institutions willing to share information. They were also extended by other developers who contributed to new features. For example, the NCSA_ added support for images in their `Mosaic browser <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)>`_ that was eventually used to create `Netscape Communications <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape>`_ and the first commercial browsers and servers."

msgid "The first components of the `world wide web` are the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), defined in :rfc:`3986`. A URI is a character string that unambiguously identifies a resource on the world wide web. Here is a subset of the BNF for URIs ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/http.rst:75
msgid "The first component of a URI is its `scheme`. A `scheme` can be seen as a selector, indicating the meaning of the fields after it. In practice, the scheme often identifies the application-layer protocol that must be used by the client to retrieve the document, but it is not always the case. Some schemes do not imply a protocol at all and some do not indicate a retrievable document [#furiretrieve]_. The most frequent schemes are `http` and `https`. We focus on `http` in this section. A URI scheme can be defined for almost any application layer protocol [#furilist]_. The characters `:` and `//` follow the `scheme` of any URI."
msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/http.rst:77
msgid "The second part of the URI is the `authority`. With retrievable URIs, this includes the DNS name or the IP address of the server where the document can be retrieved using the protocol specified via the `scheme`. This name can be preceded by some information about the user (e.g. a user name) who is requesting the information. Earlier definitions of the URI allowed the specification of a user name and a password before the `@` character (:rfc:`1738`), but this is now deprecated as placing a password inside a URI is insecure. The host name can be followed by the semicolon character and a port number. A default port number is defined for some protocols and the port number should only be included in the URI if a non-default port number is used (for other protocols, techniques like service DNS records can used)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/http.rst:80
msgid "The third part of the URI is the path to the document. This path is structured as filenames on a Unix host (but it does not imply that the files are indeed stored this way on the server). If the path is not specified, the server will return a default document. The last two optional parts of the URI are used to provide a query parameter and indicate a specific part (e.g. a section in an article) of the requested document. Sample URIs are shown below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/http.rst:91
msgid "The first URI corresponds to a document named `rfc3986.html` that is stored on the server named `tools.ietf.org` and can be accessed by using the `http` protocol on its default port. The second URI corresponds to an email message, with subject `current-issue`, that will be sent to user `infobot` in domain `example.com`. The `mailto:` URI scheme is defined in :rfc:`2368`. The third URI references the portion `BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler` of the document `basehttpserver.html` that is stored in the `library` directory on the `docs.python.org` server. This document can be retrieved by using the `http` protocol. The query parameter `highlight=http` is associated to this URI. The fourth example is a server that operates the telnet_ protocol, uses IPv6 address `2001:db8:3080:3::2` and is reachable on port 2323. The last URI is somewhat special. Most users will assume that it corresponds to a document stored on the `cnn.example.com` server. However, to parse this URI, it is important to remember that the `@` character is used to separate the user name from the host name in the authorization part of a URI. This implies that the URI points to a document named `top_story.htm` on the host having IPv4 address `10.0.0.1`. The document will be retrieved by using the `ftp` protocol with the user name set to `cnn.example.com&story=breaking_news`."

msgid "The second component of the `word wide web` is the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). HTML defines the format of the documents that are exchanged on the `web`. The `first version of HTML <http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html>`_ was derived from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) that was standardized in 1986 by :term:`ISO`. SGML_ was designed to support large documents maintained by government, law firms or aerospace companies that must be shared efficiently in a machine-readable manner. These industries require documents to remain readable and editable for tens of years and insisted on a standardized format supported by multiple vendors. Today, SGML_ is no longer widely used beyond specific applications, but its descendants including :term:`HTML` and :term:`XML` are now widespread."

The image is included in the web page by indicating its URI between brackets inside the `<img src=\"...\">` marker. It is important to note that the image can reside on any server. The client will automatically download it when rendering the web page. The `<h1>...</h1>` marker is used to specify the first level of headings. The `<ul>` marker indicates an unnumbered list while the `<li>` marker indicates a list item. The `<a href=\"URI\">text</a>` indicates a hyperlink.

msgid "HTTP was initially designed to share text documents. For this reason, and to ease the implementation of clients and servers, the designers of HTTP chose to open a TCP connection for each HTTP request. This implies that a client must open one TCP connection for each URI that it wants to retrieve from a server as illustrated on the figure below, showing HTTP 1.0 and the underlying TCP connection. For a web page containing only text documents this was a reasonable design choice as the client usually remains idle while the (human) user is reading the retrieved document."

#: ../../protocols/http.rst:252
msgid "However, as the web evolved to support richer documents containing images, opening a TCP connection for each URI became a performance problem [Mogul1995]_. Indeed, besides its HTML part, a web page may include dozens of images or more. Forcing the client to open a TCP connection for each component of a web page has two important drawbacks. First, the client and the server must exchange packets to open and close a TCP connection as we will see later. This increases the network overhead and the total delay of completely retrieving all the components of a web page. Second, a large number of established TCP connections may be a performance bottleneck on servers."

msgid "As illustrated above, a client can send several HTTP requests over the same persistent TCP connection. However, it is important to note that all of these HTTP requests are considered to be independent by the server. Each HTTP request must be self-contained. This implies that each request must include all the header lines that are required by the server to understand the request. The independence of these requests is one of the key design choices of HTTP. As a consequence of this design choice, when a server processes a HTTP request, it does not use any other information than what is contained in the request itself. This explains why the client adds its `User-Agent:` header in all of the HTTP requests that it sends over the persistent TCP connection."

msgid "However, in practice, some servers want to provide content tuned for each user. For example, some servers can provide information in several languages. Other servers want to provide advertisements that are targeted to different types of users. To do this, servers need to maintain some information about the preferences of each user and use this information to produce content matching the user's preferences. HTTP contains several mechanisms to solve this problem. We discuss three of them below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/http.rst:387
msgid "A first solution is to force the users to be authenticated. This was the solution used by `FTP` to control the files that each user could access. Initially, user names and passwords could be included inside URIs :rfc:`1738`. However, placing passwords in the clear in a potentially publicly visible URI is completely insecure and this usage has now been deprecated :rfc:`3986`. HTTP supports several extension headers :rfc:`2617` that can be used by a server to request the authentication of the client by providing his/her credentials. However, user names and passwords have not been popular on web servers as they force human users to remember one user name and one password per server. Remembering a password is acceptable when a user needs to access protected content, but users will not accept to remember a unique user name and password for each web sites that they visit."
msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/http.rst:389
msgid "A second solution to allow servers to tune that content to the needs and capabilities of the user is to rely on the different types of `Accept-*` HTTP headers. For example, the `Accept-Language:` header can be used by the client to indicate its preferred languages. Unfortunately, in practice this header is usually set based on the default language of the browser and it is difficult for a user to indicate the language it prefers by selecting options for each visited web server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/http.rst:391
msgid "The third and widely adopted solution are HTTP cookies. HTTP cookies were initially developed as a private extension by Netscape_. They are now part of the standard :rfc:`6265`. In a nutshell, a cookie is a short string that is chosen by a server to represent a given client. Two HTTP headers are used : `Cookie:` and `Set-Cookie:`. When a server receives an HTTP request from a new client (i.e. an HTTP request that does not contain the `Cookie:` header), it generates a cookie for the client and includes it in the `Set-Cookie:` header of the returned HTTP response. The `Set-Cookie:` header contains several additional parameters including the domain names for which the cookie is valid. The client stores all received cookies on disk and every time it sends an HTTP request, it verifies whether it already knows a cookie for this domain. If so, it attaches the `Cookie:` header to the HTTP request. This is illustrated in the figure below with HTTP 1.1, but cookies also work with HTTP 1.0."

However, they have also raised many discussions concerning their `potential misuses <http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/technology/04COOK.html>`_. Consider `ad.com`, a company that delivers lots of advertisements on web sites. A web site that wishes to include `ad.com`'s advertisements next to its content will add links to `ad.com` inside its HTML pages. If `ad.com` is used by many web sites, `ad.com` could be able to track the interests of all the users that visit its client websites and use this information to provide targeted advertisements. Privacy advocates have even `sued <http://epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/>`_ online advertisement companies to force them to comply with the privacy regulations.
