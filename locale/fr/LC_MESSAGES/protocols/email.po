msgid "Electronic mail, or email, is a very popular application in computer networks such as the Internet. Email `appeared <http://openmap.bbn.com/~tomlinso/ray/firstemailframe.html>`_ in the early 1970s and allows users to exchange text based messages. Initially, it was mainly used to exchange short messages, but over the years its usage has grown. It is now not only used to exchange small, but also long messages that can be composed of several parts as we will see later."

msgid "Before looking at the details of Internet email, let us consider a simple scenario illustrated in the figure below, where Alice sends an email to Bob. Alice prepares her email by using an `email clients`_ and sends it to her email server. Alice's `email server <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_mail_servers>`_ extracts Bob's address from the email and delivers the message to Bob's server. Bob retrieves Alice's message on his server and reads it by using his favorite email client or through his webmail interface."

msgid "Initially, email was used to exchange small messages of ASCII text between computer scientists. However, with the growth of the Internet, supporting only ASCII text became a severe limitation for two reasons. First of all, non-English speakers wanted to write emails in their native language that often required more characters than those of the ASCII character table. Second, many users wanted to send other content than just ASCII text by email such as binary files, images or sound."

msgid "To solve this problem, the IETF_ developed the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (:term:`MIME`). These extensions were carefully designed to allow Internet email to carry non-ASCII characters and binary files without breaking the email servers that were deployed at that time. This requirement for backward compatibility forced the MIME designers to develop extensions to the existing email message format :rfc:`822` instead of defining a completely new format that would have been better suited to support the new types of emails."

Other versions of MIME may be defined in the future. Thanks to this header line, the software that processes email messages will be able to adapt to the MIME version used to encode the message. Messages that do not contain this header are supposed to be formatted according to the original :rfc:`822` specification."

MIME allows the utilization of other character encodings."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/email.rst:183
msgid "To support these two types of MIME messages, the recipient of a message must be able to extract the different parts from the message. In :rfc:`822`, an empty line was used to separate the header lines from the body. Using an empty line to separate the different parts of an email body would be difficult as the body of email messages often contains one or more empty lines. Another possible option would be to define a special line, e.g. `*-LAST_LINE-*` to mark the boundary between two parts of a MIME message. Unfortunately, this is not possible as some emails may contain this string in their body (e.g. emails sent to students to explain the format of MIME messages). To solve this problem, the `Content-Type:` header line contains a second parameter that specifies the string that has been used by the sender of the MIME message to delineate the different parts. In practice, this string is often chosen randomly by the mail client."

msgid "The email message below, copied from :rfc:`2046` shows a MIME message containing two parts that are both in plain text and encoded using the ASCII character set.

There are several subtypes : `text/plain` for regular ASCII text, `text/html` defined in :rfc:`2854` for documents in :term:`HTML` format or the `text/enriched` format defined in :rfc:`1896`. The `Content-Type:` header line may contain a second parameter that specifies the character set used to encode the text. `charset=us-ascii` is the standard ASCII character table.  Other frequent character sets include `charset=UTF8` or `charset=iso-8859-1`. The `list of standard character sets <http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets>`_ is maintained by :term:`IANA`."

msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/email.rst:214
msgid "`audio`. The message part contains an audio clip. The subtype indicates the format of the audio clip like `wav <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wav>`_ or `mp3 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3>`_."

msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/email.rst:220
msgid "The first computers used different techniques to represent characters in memory and on disk. During the 1960s, computers began to exchange information via tape or telephone lines. Unfortunately, each vendor had its own proprietary character set and exchanging data between computers from different vendors was often difficult. The 7 bits ASCII character table :rfc:`20` was adopted by several vendors and by many Internet protocols. However, ASCII became a problem with the internationalization of the Internet and the desire of more and more users to use character sets that support their own written language. A first attempt at solving this problem was the definition of the ISO-8859_ character sets by :term:`ISO`. This family of standards specified various character sets that allowed the representation of many European written languages by using 8 bits characters. Unfortunately, an 8-bits character set is not sufficient to support some widely used languages, such as those used in Asian countries. Fortunately, at the end of the 1980s, several computer scientists proposed to develop a standard that supports all written languages used on Earth today. The Unicode standard [Unicode]_ has now been adopted by most computer and software vendors. For example, Java always uses Unicode to manipulate characters, Python can handle both ASCII and Unicode characters. Internet applications are slowly moving towards complete support for the Unicode character sets, but moving from ASCII to Unicode is an important change that can have a huge impact on current deployed implementations. See, for example, the work to completely internationalize email :rfc:`4952` and domain names :rfc:`5890`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../protocols/email.rst:222
msgid "The last MIME header line is `Content-Transfer-Encoding:`. This header line is used after the `Content-Type:` header line, within a message part, and specifies how the message part has been encoded. The default encoding is to use 7 bits ASCII. The most frequent encodings are `quoted-printable` and `Base64`. Both support encoding a sequence of bytes into a set of ASCII lines that can be safely transmitted by email servers. `quoted-printable` is defined in :rfc:`2045`. We briefly describe `base64` which is defined in :rfc:`2045` and :rfc:`4648`."

The figure below illustrates the protocols that are used when `Alice` sends an email message to `Bob`. `Alice` prepares her email with an email client or on a webmail interface. To send her email to `Bob`, `Alice`'s client will use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (:term:`SMTP`) to deliver her message to her SMTP server. `Alice`'s email client is configured with the name of the default SMTP server for her domain. There is usually at least one SMTP server per domain. To deliver the message, `Alice`'s SMTP server must find the SMTP server that contains `Bob`'s mailbox. This can be done by using the Mail eXchange (MX) records of the DNS. A set of MX records can be associated to each domain. Each MX record contains a numerical preference and the fully qualified domain name of a SMTP server that is able to deliver email messages destined to all valid email addresses of this domain. The DNS can return several MX records for a given domain. In this case, the server with the lowest numerical preference is used first :rfc:`2821`. If this server is not reachable, the second most preferred server is used etc. `Bob`'s SMTP server will store the message sent by `Alice` until `Bob` retrieves it using a webmail interface or protocols such as the Post Office Protocol (:term:`POP`) or the Internet Message Access Protocol (:term:`IMAP`)."

The MUA is usually either an email client or a webmail. The MUA sends the email message to a Mail Submission Agent (MSA). The MSA processes the received email and forwards it to the Mail Transmission Agent (MTA). The MTA is responsible for the transmission of the email, directly or via intermediate MTAs to the MTA of the destination domain. This destination MTA will then forward the message to the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) where it will be accessed by the recipient's MUA. SMTP is used for the interactions between MUA and MSA [#fsmtpauth]_, MSA-MTA and MTA-MTA."

The first documented abuse of email for marketing purposes occurred in 1978 when a marketer who worked for a computer vendor sent a `marketing email <http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamreact.html#msg>`_ to many ARPANET users. At that time, the ARPANET could only be used for research purposes and this was an abuse of the acceptable use policy. Unfortunately, given the extremely low cost of sending emails, the problem of unsolicited emails has not stopped. Unsolicited emails are now called spam and a `study <http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/res/other-areas/anti-spam-measures>`_ carried out by ENISA_ in 2009 reveals that 95% of email was spam and this number seems to continue to grow.

msgid "When the first versions of SMTP were designed, the Internet was composed of minicomputers that were used by an entire university department or research lab. These minicomputers were used by many users at the same time. Email was mainly used to send messages from a user on a given host to another user on a remote host. At that time, SMTP was the only protocol involved in the delivery of the emails as all hosts attached to the network were running an SMTP server. On such hosts, an email destined to local users was delivered by placing the email in a special directory or file owned by the user. However, the introduction of personal computers in the 1980s changed this environment. Initially, users of these personal computers used applications such as :term:`telnet` to open a remote session on the local :term:`minicomputer` to read their email. This was not user-friendly. A better solution appeared with the development of user friendly email client applications on personal computers. Several protocols were designed to allow these client applications to retrieve the email messages destined to a user from his/her server. Two of these protocols became popular and are still used today. The Post Office Protocol (POP), defined in :rfc:`1939`, is the simplest one. It allows a client to download all the messages destined to a given user from his/her email server. We describe POP briefly in this section. The second protocol is the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), defined in :rfc:`3501`. IMAP is more powerful, but also more complex than POP. IMAP was designed to allow client applications to efficiently access, in real-time, to messages stored in various folders on servers. IMAP assumes that all the messages of a given user are stored on a server and provides the functions that are necessary to search, download, delete or filter messages."
