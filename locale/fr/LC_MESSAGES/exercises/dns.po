msgid "The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a key role in the Internet today as it allows applications to use fully qualified domain names (FQDN) instead of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. When using the DNS, it is important to remember the role of the different types of DNS records."

#: ../../exercises/dns.rst:25
msgid "Several software tools can be used to send queries to DNS servers. For this exercise, we use dig_ which is installed on most Unix/Linux systems."

#: ../../exercises/dns.rst:48
msgid "When run without any parameter, `dig` queries one of the root DNS servers and retrieves the list of the names of all root DNS servers. For technical reasons, there are only 13 different root DNS servers. This information is also available as a text file from http://www.internic.net/zones/named.root. What are the IPv6 addresses of all these servers?"

msgid "Use `dig` to find the mail relays used by the `uclouvain.be` and `student.uclouvain.be` domains. What is the `TTL` of these records ? Can you explain the preferences used by the `MX` records. You can find more information about the MX records in :rfc:`5321`."

msgid "When `dig` is run, the header section in its output indicates the `id` the DNS identifier used to send the query. Does your implementation of `dig` generates random identifiers ?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/dns.rst:73
msgid "A DNS implementation such as `dig`, and more importantly a name resolver such as bind_ or unbound_, always checks that the received DNS reply contains the same identifier as the DNS request that it sent. Why is this so important ?"

msgid "The DNS protocol can run over UDP and over TCP. Most DNS servers prefer to use UDP because it consumes fewer resources on the server. However, TCP is useful when a large answer is expected. Compare `time dig +tcp` and `time dig` to query a root DNS server. Is it faster to receive an answer via TCP or via UDP ?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/dns.rst:84
msgid "Besides `dig`, another way to analyze the DNS is to look at packet traces with tools such as `wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org>`_ or `tcpdump <https://www.tcpdump.org>`_ These tools can capture packets in a network and also display and analyze their content. `Wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org>`_  provides a flexible Graphical User Interface that eases the analysis of the captured packets. The three questions below should help you to better understand the important fields of DNS messages."

msgid "When a client requests the mapping of a domain name into an IP address to its local resolver, the resolver may need to query a large number of nameservers starting from the root nameserver. The three exercises below show packet traces collected while the resolver was resolving the following names: `www.example.com`, `www.google.com` and `www.computer-networking.info`. If you understand how the DNS operates, you should be able to correctly reorder those packet traces."
