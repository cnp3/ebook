msgid "In this series of exercises, you will explore in more details the operation of TCP and its congestion control scheme. TCP is a very important protocol in today's Internet since most applications use it to exchange data. We first look at TCP in more details by injecting segments in the Linux TCP stack and analyze how the stack reacts. Then we study the TCP congestion control scheme."

msgid "Packet capture tools like tcpdump_ and Wireshark_ are very useful to observe the segments that transport protocols exchange. TCP is a complex protocol that has evolved a lot since its first specification :rfc:`793`. TCP includes a large number of heuristics that influence the reaction of a TCP implementation to various types of events. A TCP implementation interacts with the application through the ``socket`` API."

msgid "packetdrill_ is a TCP test suite that was designed to develop unit tests to verify the correct operation of a TCP implementation. A more detailed description of packetdrill_ may be found in [CCB+2013]_. packetdrill_ uses a syntax which is a mix between the C language and the tcpdump_ syntax. To understand the operation of packetdrill_, we first discuss several examples. The TCP implementation in the Linux kernel supports all the recent TCP extensions to improve its performance. For pedagogical reasons, we disable [#fsysctl]_ most of these extensions to use a simple TCP stack. packetdrill_ can be easily installed on recent Linux kernels [#finstall]_."

msgid "Each line of a packetdrill_ script starts with a `timing` parameter that indicates at what time the event specified on this line should happen. packetdrill_ supports absolute and relative timings. An absolute timing is simply a number that indicates the delay in seconds between the start of the script and the event. A relative timing is indicated by using ``+``  followed by a number. This number is then the delay in seconds between the previous event and the current line. Additional information may be found in [CCB+2013]_."

msgid "The description of TCP packets in packetdrill_ uses a syntax that is very close to the tcpdump_ one. The ``+0`` timing indicates that the line is executed immediately after the previous event. The ``<`` sign indicates that packetdrill_ injects a TCP segment and the ``S`` character indicates that the ``SYN`` flag must be set. Like tcpdump_, packetdrill_ uses sequence numbers that are relative to initial sequence number. The three numbers that follow are the sequence number of the first byte of the payload of the segment (``0``), the sequence number of the last byte of the payload of the segment (``0`` after the semi-column) and the length of the payload (``0`` between brackets) of the ``SYN`` segment. This segment does not contain a valid acknowledgment but advertises a window of 1000 bytes. All ``SYN`` segments must also include the ``MSS`` option. In this case, we set the MSS to 1000 bytes. The next line of the packetdrill_ script verifies the reply sent by the instrumented Linux kernel."

For outgoing packets, packetdrill_ does not verify the value of the advertised window. In this line, it also accepts any TCP options (``<...>``)."

msgid "Let us first explore how a TCP connection can be established. In the previous script, we have injected the segments that a client would send to a server. We can also use the Linux stack as a client and inject the segments that a server would return. Such a client process would first create its :manpage:`socket`` and then issue the :manpage:`connect` system call. At this point, the stack sends a ``SYN`` segment. To simplify the scripts, we have configured the stack to use a ``MSS`` of 1000 bytes and disabled the TCP extensions (the details of this configuration may be found at the beginning of the script). The server replies with a ``SYN+ACK`` and the stack sends acknowledges it to finish the three-way-handshake."

#: ../../exercises/tcp-2.rst:167
msgid "Another example is the simultaneous establishment of a TCP connection. The TCP stack sends a ``SYN`` and receives a ``SYN`` in response instead of a ``SYN+ACK``. It then acknowledges the received ``SYN`` and retransmits its own ``SYN``. The connection becomes established upon reception of the fourth segment. This script is available from :download:`/exercises/packetdrill_scripts/dual.pkt`."

msgid "Another usage of packetdrill_ is to explore how a TCP connection ends. The scripts below show how a TCP stack closes a TCP connection.

#: ../../exercises/tcp-2.rst:259
msgid "Another very interesting utilization of packetdrill_ is to explore how a TCP stack reacts to acknowledgments that would correspond to lost or reordered segments. For this analysis, we configure a very large initial congestion window to ensure that the connection does not start with a slow-start."
msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/tcp-2.rst:261
msgid "Let us first use packetdrill_ to explore the evolution of the TCP retransmission timeout. The value of this timeout is set based on the measured round-trip-time and its variance. When the retransmission timer expires, TCP doubles the retransmission timer. This exponential backoff mechanism is important to ensure that TCP slowdowns during very severe congestion periods. We use the ``tcpi_rto`` variable from ``TCP_INFO`` to track the evolution of the retransmission timer. This script is available from :download:`/exercises/packetdrill_scripts/rto.pkt`."

msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/tcp-2.rst:326
msgid "A TCP stack uses both the fast retransmit technique and retransmission timers. A retransmission timer can fire after a fast retransmit when several segments are lost.

However, they did not consider the interactions with the congestion control scheme since the use a large initial congestion window. We now set the initial congestion window to two MSS-sized segments and use the ``tcpi_snd_cwnd`` and ``tcpi_snd_ssthresh`` variables from ``TCP_INFO`` to explore the evolution of the TCP congestion control scheme. Our first script looks at the evolution of the congestion window during a slow-start when there are no losses.

msgstr ""

#: ../../exercises/tcp-2.rst:502
msgid "We can now explore how TCP's retransmission techniques interact with the congestion control scheme. The Linux TCP code that combines these two techniques contains several heuristics to improve their performance. We start with a transfer of 8KBytes where the penultimate segment is not received by the remote host. In this case, TCP does not receive enough acknowledgments to trigger the fast retransmit and it must wait for the expiration of the retransmission timer. This script is available from :download:`/exercises/packetdrill_scripts/slow-start-rto2.pkt`."

msgid "Another interesting scenario is when the loss happens early in the data transfer. This is shown in the script below where the second segment is lost.
